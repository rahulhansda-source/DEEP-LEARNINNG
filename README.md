# Description
Deep learning is a powerful subfield of machine learning that enables computers to learn complex patterns from large datasets using neural networks. In Task 2 of the CodTech Data Science Internship, the goal is to implement a deep learning model for either image classification or natural language processing (NLP) using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This task helps interns gain practical experience with neural networks, a key component of modern artificial intelligence systems.
The task begins with choosing one of the two popular deep learning application areas:

Image Classification – recognizing the content of images (e.g., digits, animals, objects).

Natural Language Processing – understanding and processing human language (e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification).

For image classification, the MNIST dataset is a commonly used starting point. It contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The model used for this task is typically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for extracting spatial features from images.

In the implementation:

The data is loaded and normalized (pixel values scaled between 0 and 1).

A CNN model is built using TensorFlow’s Keras API. It includes layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense to progressively extract features and classify the image.

The model is compiled using an optimizer like Adam, a loss function such as sparse categorical crossentropy, and metrics like accuracy.

The model is trained over multiple epochs on training data and validated using test data to evaluate performance.

Finally, the results are visualized by plotting training and validation accuracy over epochs.

For NLP tasks, datasets like the IMDB movie reviews dataset are used. Here, the objective is to classify a review as positive or negative. Text data is tokenized and transformed into sequences of integers. A deep learning model such as an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network is often used for such sequential data. The structure typically includes:

An Embedding layer to represent words as dense vectors,

One or more LSTM or GRU layers for capturing temporal relationships,

A final Dense layer with a sigmoid or softmax activation for classification.

Regardless of the application chosen, the task emphasizes not only training a functional model but also visualizing performance metrics, such as loss and accuracy curves. These visualizations help understand the model's learning behavior and diagnose issues like overfitting or underfitting.

The objective of this task is to give interns a hands-on introduction to the complete deep learning workflow—data preparation, model design, training, evaluation, and visualization. Through this, interns develop an intuitive understanding of how neural networks work and how to tune their architectures for better performance.
